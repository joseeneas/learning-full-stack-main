/**
 * Main Application Styles
 * 
 * This stylesheet contains the core styling for the React application including:
 * - App container layout and alignment
 * - App logo styling and rotation animation
 * - Header section with flexbox layout
 * - Link styling
 * - Custom badge styling for Ant Design components
 * - Keyframe animations for logo rotation
 * 
 * @media prefers-reduced-motion - Respects user's motion preferences
 * @keyframes App-logo-spin - Defines 360-degree rotation animation over 20 seconds
 */
 
/* 
* This CSS rule targets any element with the class App. Applying text-align: center centers inline content (text, inline-blocks, 
* inline images) horizontally within that element’s content box. It does not affect block-level elements’ own horizontal positioning 
* unless they are inline or their internal inline content is what needs centering. For broader layout centering (e.g., centering the 
* container itself), additional properties (margin: 0 auto; display settings; flexbox) would be required.
*/

  text-align: center;
}
/* 
 * This rule styles any element with the class App-logo. The height is set to 40vmin, which means 40% of the viewport’s smaller dimension 
 * (width or height). This makes the logo scale responsively with the screen size and orientation. Because only the height is set, the width 
 * remains auto, preserving the image’s intrinsic aspect ratio. 
 * pointer-events: none disables mouse and touch interaction on the element. Clicks, hovers, and drag events pass through to elements underneath, 
 * effectively making the logo decorative and non-interactive. It doesn’t affect rendering or animations, and it doesn’t automatically remove 
 * keyboard focus from inherently focusable elements, but it will prevent the element from being clicked with a pointer. If interaction is needed 
 * on a child, you can set pointer-events: auto on that child.

/* 
 * This media query checks if the user has not indicated a preference for reduced motion. If they haven’t, it applies an infinite rotation 
 * animation to elements with the class App-logo. The animation named App-logo-spin runs continuously with a duration of 20 seconds per 
 * complete rotation, using a linear timing function for consistent speed.

 * This rule styles elements with the class App-header. It sets a dark background color, makes the header take at least the full viewport 
 * height, and uses flexbox to center its content both vertically and horizontally. The font size is responsive, calculated as 10 pixels plus 
 * 2% of the viewport’s smaller dimension (width or height). The text color is set to white for contrast against the dark background.

/* 
 * This rule targets elements with the class site-badge-count-4 that contain a child element with the class ant-badge-count. It applies 
 * specific styles to the badge count, including a left margin of 10 pixels, a text color of #999 (a medium gray), a white background color, 
 * and an inset box shadow that creates a subtle border effect using a light gray color (#d9d9d9).
