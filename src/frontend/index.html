<!--
  Main HTML entry point for the Full Stack Professional application.
  
  This file serves as the root HTML document for a React-based web application.
  
  Key features:
  - Sets up the document structure with proper meta tags for character encoding and viewport
  - Includes favicon and Apple touch icon for branding across devices
  - Defines a root div element where the React application will be mounted
  - Links to the main.jsx module which bootstraps the React application
  - Includes a web app manifest for Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
  
  The application uses Vite as the build tool, which processes the module script
  and handles hot module replacement during development.
